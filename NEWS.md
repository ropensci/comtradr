comtradr 0.1.0.09000
====================

## NEW FEATURES

* Modifications to `ct_search()` to allow for pulling all monthly data for an entire year in a single query (issue [#14](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/14))
* For function `ct_search()`, expanded the valid input types for args `start_date` and `end_date` (issue [#10](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/10)).

## BUG FIXES

* The updates generated by function `ct_update_databases()` are now properly preserved between R sessions (issue [#11](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/11)).
* Passing `"services"` to arg `type` within function `ct_search()` now uses commodity scheme `EB02` by default (previously this would throw an error, fixes issue [#6](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/6)).
* When using commodity scheme `EB02` within function `ct_search()`, passing `"TOTAL"` to arg `commod_codes` no longer returns zero results (issue [#7](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/7)).
* `ct_commodity_lookup()` no longer returns zero results when passing all caps input to arg `search_terms` (issue [#9](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/9)).


comtradr 0.1.0
===================

## PKG API CHANGES

* Eliminated functions `ct_commodities_table` and `ct_countries_table`.
* Added new functions `ct_update_databases`, `ct_use_pretty_cols`, `ct_commodity_db_type`, `ct_register_token`, `ct_get_reset_time`, `ct_get_remaining_hourly_queries`.
* Renamed functions: `commodity_lookup` is now `ct_commodity_lookup`, `country_lookup` is now `ct_country_lookup`.
* The commodity and country reference tables are now saved as cached package data, and accessed by `comtradr` functions when necessary. This replaces the need for functions `ct_commodities_table` and `ct_countries_table`.
* Reorder function arguments within function `ct_search`.
* Changed some function argument names to ensure `snake_case` is being used throughout the package.
* `ct_search` now returns a data frame, as opposed to a list.

## MINOR CHANGES

* Added a vignette directory, with an "Intro to comtradr" vignette.
* API requests are now throttled based on the [rate limits](https://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api/#Limits) imposed by the UN Comtrade.
* Added function for setting a valid API key/token (`ct_register_token`).
* Appending API metadata to each returned data frame as attributes (url of the API call, date-time of the query, duration of the query in seconds).
* Added package level man page.
* Now using native R errors/warnings, as opposed to nesting API status codes in a returned list.
* `Imports` changes: remove `dplyr`, add `magrittr` and `purrr`.
* Expand and improve test coverage via [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat).

## BUG FIXES

* The issues related to type-safety in function `commodity_lookup` have been fixed by importing `purrr` and using `purrr::map` in place of `sapply`. This fixes [issue #2](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/2) and [issue #3](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/3).


comtradr 0.0.2 (2017-07-03)
===========================

## NEW FEATURES

* commodity_lookup(): Expanded function to accept multiple commodities or commodity codes (as either character vector or numeric vector). Also added argument "return_char" that allows the user to specify list output or char vector output, and argument "return_code" that specifies output of commodity descriptions or commodity codes.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Add unit tests via [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat).
