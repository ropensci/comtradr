## Caching requests from the UN Comtrade API

There is four reasons why we might want to use caching for our requests
to the UN Comtrade API:

-   The UN Comtrade API at times can be a bit slow 🐌
-   Free users only have a limited amount of requests 💸
-   We might want to insulate our analysis against updates to the
    official data 📦
-   It saves energy and is climate friendly to not repeat requests that
    return the same data every time. 🌍

The package offers a caching option, that is fairly easy to use.

### The basics of caching 💽

When you set the respective argument to `TRUE`, a directory named
`comtradr` will be set up in your cache directory. This is determined by
the `rappdirs::user_cache_dir` function. It has the default values for a
cache as used by `cachem::cache_disk`.

See here: <https://cachem.r-lib.org/reference/cache_disk.html>

and here: <https://rappdirs.r-lib.org/reference/user_cache_dir.html>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#### Now
q <- ct_get_data(reporter = "USA", 
               partner = c("DEU", "FRA", "JPN", "MEX"), 
               flow_direction = "import",
               start_date = 2020,
               end_date = 2023,
               cache = TRUE) # <----- set this argument to TRUE
```

If you want to modify these parameters, you need to set environment
variables. You can use the `usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = 'project)`
function to set them only for your current project.

ℹ️ Restart your R Session after setting the environment variables! 💡

The parameters are:

-   `COMTRADR_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` = Maximum size of the cache, in bytes. If
    the cache exceeds this size, cached objects will be removed
    according to the value of the `evict`. Use `Inf` for no size limit.
    The default is 1 gigabyte.

-   `COMTRADR_CACHE_MAX_AGE` = Maximum age of files in cache before they
    are evicted, in seconds. Use `Inf` for no age limit.

-   `COMTRADR_CACHE_MAX_N` = Maximum number of objects in the cache. If
    the number of objects exceeds this value, then cached objects will
    be removed according to the value of `evict`. Use `Inf` for no limit
    of number of items.

-   `R_USER_CACHE_DIR` = Directory where the cached files will be saved.
